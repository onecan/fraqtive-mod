This is an extension of Fraqtive for the IHS Fractals and Chaos class.
The goals are:
1. Show orbits in Julia Sets
2. Mark where Julia sets occur in the Mandelbrot fractal
3. Fully comment and document this code to make extension easier in the future.

Note: You will need to run the ./configure on your own system to build.

Fraqtive
Version 0.4.8 (2015-01-29)

Mandelbrot family fractal generator.

Fraqtive is an open source, multi-platform generator of the Mandelbrot
family fractals. It uses very fast algorithms supporting SSE2
and multi-core processors. It generates high quality anti-aliased
images and renders 3D scenes using OpenGL. It allows real-time
navigation and dynamic generation of the Julia fractal preview.
